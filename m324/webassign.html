How to use Webassign

<p> 

In order to access and submit your homework for grading, you
will use <i>Webassign</i>. You will need a "Webassign access code." 
After logging in to Webassign, you can follow their prompts to purchase an access code that will just allow you to turn in homework OR purchase a code that allows you to turn in homework and view an electronic version of the text.  Students who wish to purchase a hard copy of the text, bundled with a Webassign access code, may do so at the university bookstore.

Here is a description of how to get registered on <i>Webassign</i> and begin
accessing the homework. 

<ul>

<li> Open a web browser (Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer, etc.).

<li> Go to this web address:
<center>

        <a href = "https://www.webassign.net/washington/login.html">https://www.webassign.net/washington/login.html</a> .
</CENTER>


<li>  Click on the "LOG IN"
button. You'll be asked to log in to your MyUW account.  You should end up at a page with access to your Math 324 assignments. 


<li> Under "My classes" drop down menu, select our class.  You will
then be able to access current assignments, grades etc.


<li> The "Guide" and "Help" links in the upper right corner may help
you find your way around <i>Webassign.</i>

<li> When you open up a homework assignment, you will see empty
boxes for your answers. Sometimes the answers
are numerical (e.g., 1.25 or 5/4), 
sometimes symbolic (e.g., <i> 2x + x<sup>2 </sup></i>). A palette of mathematical symbols
is provided to allow you to enter symbolic notation.

<li> When you open a homework assignment, you have the option to
submit an answer OR save your work for later. You can
also print out the entire homework, work on it away from the computer,
then return and enter answers later. 

<li> 
On most questions, you are allowed 5 tries to enter the correct answer.
After five incorrect submissions, the correct answer pops up and you are given 0 on
that particular question.  (The number of submissions for a multiple choice question depends on the number of answer choices, but is usually one or two submissions.  For True/False or Yes/No questions, you get only one submission.  To see the number of allowed submissions, click on the "Question Details" link at the top of the question.)

<li>    You will find that many of the
problems
have "randomized" numbers in them. For example, on a particular problem
your homework may involve working with the equation
<i>
2 x<sup>2 </sup>+ 3y<sup>2</sup> = 7
</i>.
However, when you look at your friend's homework, the same problem
 might instead involve the equation 
<i>
3 x<sup>2 </sup>+ 5y<sup>2</sup> = 7
</i>.
These slight randomized changes insure that no single answer key
can be posted online for everyone to use.
